# Description

Simply create a rest service for Featherjs from a mongoose schema

# Why use this plugin?

Keep your existing mongoose models and their advantages (with the constraints, validations and cascades) and use the power of feathersjs for simply creating rest services with a line of code.

# How to use it?

Coming soon

# Thanks

This work is based on the official [feathers-mongo plugin](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-mongodb) and the initial [feathers-mongoose plugin](https://github.com/marshallswain/feathers-mongoose-advanced) and merge the benefits of these two :)

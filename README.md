# feathers-mongoose-rest

## Description

This is a [feathersjs](http://feathersjs.com/) plugin for simply creating rest services from mongoose models.

## Why use this plugin?

- Keep your existing mongoose models and their advantages (constraints, validations, hooks)
- Use feathersjs for automatically creating rest services with a single line of code
- Full advanced rest features (sorting, filtering, paging, populating, selecting)
- Compatible with the latest versions of feathersjs (1.x)

## How to use it?

Coming very soon

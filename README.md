# feathers-mongoose-rest

## Description

This is a [feathersjs](http://feathersjs.com/) plugin for simply creating rest services from mongoose models.

## Why use this plugin?

Keep your existing mongoose models and their advantages (with the constraints, validations and cascades) and use the power of feathersjs for simply creating rest services with a single line of code. Compatible with the latest versions of feathersjs (1.x)

## How to use it?

Coming soon

## Thanks

This work is based on the official [feathers-mongo plugin](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-mongodb) and the initial [feathers-mongoose plugin](https://github.com/marshallswain/feathers-mongoose-advanced) and merge the benefits of these two :)
